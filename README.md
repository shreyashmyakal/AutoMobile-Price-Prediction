# AutoMobile-Price-Prediction
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.
 So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through how to train a car price prediction model with machine learning using Python.
Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are: Bore, Stroke, HorsePower etc.
# Car Price Prediction Model using Python.
The dataset I’m using here to train a car price prediction model was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about all the main features that contribute to the price of a car. So let’s start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/CarPrice.csv.
There are 26 columns in this dataset, so it is very important to check whether or not this dataset contains null values before going any further.
